Add initial guesses for ICP. And properly implement Point-to-Line ICP.
Add some way to know how sh*t a map is. Maybe find "fragmentation" in walls? discontinuities?
Test with noise

THE CUDA ISSUE IS WITH THE SYSTEM SOLUTION.
IT WAS A FUCKING NEGATIVE SIGN FUCKKKKKK
GOD DAMN IT I LOVE/HATE PROGRAMMING

anyways right now the issue is that python is straight up too slow. not even joking.

I'll port over the code to C++, primarily the map and particle system. Then, I'll port over the whole SLAM stack and use pybind as a front
(note: figure out how to use cuda with pybind)
We have to decide if we should use cv2 Mat or eigen Matrix for our occupancy grid in c++

let's leave a stable version right now for Project R.
