Add initial guesses for ICP. And properly implement Point-to-Line ICP.
Add some way to know how sh*t a map is. Maybe find "fragmentation" in walls? discontinuities?
Test with noise

THE CUDA ISSUE IS WITH THE SYSTEM SOLUTION.
soooo actually ::::
the problem seems to be rooted much higher. We're getting some bad data entering the function, and as such, GIGO.
figure out wtf is happening with the correlations n transforms n such plz :))))
last changes were just printing stuff both on cuda and cpp

Ok, checklist:
Correspondences: Passed the same, line calc mostly equal (rounding error on cpu, but its 1e-7 so it shouldn't be too bad).
